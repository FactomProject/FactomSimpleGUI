# FactomSimpleGUI

This application is hard coded to the Entry Credit Pool set up by Github user EC-Faucet mentioned in the post:

It takes up to 3 external IDs and content text to be added to the Factom Blockchain.  It does not require running factom components.  It operates with http posts to a publicly facing Factomd server.


This is not a wallet.  It does not keep track of your transactions.  You need to write down your entry hashes to find them at a later time.    It is an example of how to use java to program agianst factom.

FactomSimpleGUI.jar is an executable jar file.  With java on your system, run:

java -jar FactomSimpleEntryGUI.jar
