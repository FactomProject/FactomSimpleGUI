This application is hard coded to the Entry Credit Pool set up by Github user EC-Faucet mentioned in the post:

It takes up to 3 external IDs and content text to be added to the Factom Blockchain.  It does not require running factom components.  It operates with http posts to a publicly facing Factomd server.
